cAdvisor (Container Advisor) provides container users an understanding of the resource usage and performance characteristics of their running containers. 
It is a running daemon that collects, aggregates, processes, and exports information about running containers.

Installation procedure
sudo docker run \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:ro \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  --volume=/dev/disk/:/dev/disk:ro \
  --publish=8080:8080 \
  --detach=true \
  --name=cadvisor \
  google/cadvisor:latest

cAdvisor is now running (in the background) on http://localhost:8080. The setup includes directories with Docker state cAdvisor needs to observe.
