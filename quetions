1. what is K8s vs.Docker?
=> Docker provides an open standard for packaging and distributing containerized applications. Using Docker,You can build 
   and run containers, and store and share container images.
   
=> Kubernetes orchestrates and manages the distributed, Containerized application that docker creates. It also provides the 
   infrastructure needed to deploy and run those applications on a cluster of machines.
   
2. What is a Kubernetes deployment?
=> A Kubernetes deployment allows you to describe your desired application deployment state. k8s scheduler ensures the actual 
   state matches your desired state and maintains that state in the event one or more pods crash. K8s deployments also allow 
   you to consistently upgrade your applications without downtime

3. How do i deploy to K8s using DevOps practices?
=> Deployment to k8s using DevOps typically involves a respository such as Git for management. The repository servers 
   as the beginning of the CI/CD line. Depending on the appoarch you use,    changes in the repository trigger integration,
   build, delivery and deployment activities.
