Whenever we install Docker on CentOS or RHEL Servers Docker public Registry is enabled so when we run ‘docker pull‘ or 
‘docker search‘ command it will go to Docker public registry (Docker Hub) and will fetch the required container images. 
But it is not idea to fetch the Docker container images from public registry when you are using Docker in an organization, 
for the best practice we should have our own private Docker registry or repository. Docker Registry or repository is a place
where Docker container images are stored.

################ how to setup our own Docker private registry on CentOS 7.x #################

=> I will be using three CentOS 7.x Servers and assuming docker is already installed and its service is up and running on 
   all three servers. 
=> Below are the details of my three servers:

=> docker-repo.example.com {192.168.56.14} -> It will act as my Docker private Registry Server

=> docker.developers.com {192.168.56.29} -> On this Server Docker admins and developers will create their own container
   images either with dockerfile or with compose and then they will upload these images to their own docker private registry
   server (docker-repo.example.com) with docker push command
   
=> docker.download.com {192.168.56.31} -> On this Server we will download docker container images from our own private 
  registry server with ‘docker pull‘ command

Note : Update the /etc/hosts file in case DNS server is not configured so that servers can be reachable with their
       respective hostname or dns name.
       
#vim /etc/hosts
192.168.56.14     docker-repo.example.com docker-repo
192.168.56.29     docker.developers.com   developers
192.168.56.31     docker.download.com     download

=> Step:1 Download and start registry Container on your private registry server
   Login to the server which you want to configure as Docker Private Registry Server, in my case it is 
   “docker-repo.example.com”.I am assuming Docker package is already installed on it and its service is up and running.
   In case Docker is not installed please refer the below
   
   #### How to install Docker on CentOS 7 ####
   
=> Next task is to start the program or script which will configure and make your server as Registry Server. 
   That Program or script  is started by running a docker registry container. Let’s first download the registry 
   container using beneath command 
   
 [root@docker-repo ~]# docker pull registry      
 
 => Once the image is downloaded verify which commands will be executed when we start registry container image.
 
 [root@docker-repo ~]# docker history registry
 
 => Now start the registry container using below command
 
 [root@docker-repo ~]# docker run -dit -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry
 
 => Above Command will start the registry container with name registry and also we set the patting rule so that if any 
    request comes to ‘docker-repo.example.com‘ on 5000 port then request will be redirected to registry container on 5000 port.
 
 [root@docker-repo ~]# docker ps
 
 Note: In case firewall is enabled on your private registry server then open 80 port using the following command
 
 [root@docker-repo ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
 
 [root@docker-repo ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
